# kopengi
### Regan Russell

kopengi is an open-source, cross-platform game engine written in C++. It is built on the theory of
not reinventing the wheel, and creating a logical, easy to use engine structure that makes development
simple and understandable. It relies on OpenGL and various helper libraries to make my job easier, and
keep the engine itself as straightforward as possible.

The following third-party libraries are used:
* GLFW
* GLEW
* ASSIMP
* SOIL
* GLM

kopengi (for the time being) can be modified but not sold, nor used in any commercial projects.
